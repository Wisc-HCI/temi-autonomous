This will start out as a standalone websocket-server & react frontend project,
where the WS acts as a bridge between the Temi robot and the frontend wizard controller.

At some point, we may integrate a variation of this websocket server into the ROS system,
and use it to create a more autonomous interaction flow.

This code is also dependent on a compatible Temi app (with WS client built-in) installed on Temi.
